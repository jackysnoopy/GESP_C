# [POI 2005] SUM-Fibonacci Sums

## 题目描述

Fibonacci numbers are an integer sequence defined in the following way: $Fib_0=1$, $Fib_1=1$, $Fib_i=Fib_{i-1}+Fib_{i-2}$ (for $i\ge 2$). The first few numbers in this sequence are: ($1,1,2,3,5,8,\cdots$).

The great computer scientist Byteazar is constructing an unusual computer, in which numbers are represented in Fibonacci system i.e. a bit string $(b_1,b_2,\cdots,b_n)$ denotes the number $b_1\cdot Fib_1+b_2\cdot Fib_2+\cdots+b_n\cdot Fib_n$. (Note that we do not use $Fib_0$.) Unfortunately, such a representation is ambiguous i.e. the same number can have different representations. The number $42$, for instance, can be written as: $(0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1)$, $(0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0)$ or $(1,1,0,1,0,1,1)$. For this very reason, Byteazar has limited himself to only using representations satisfying the following conditions:

if $n>1$, then $b_n=1$, i.e. the representation of a number does not contain leading zeros.

if $b_i=1$, then $b_{i+1}=0$ (for $i=1,\cdots,n-1$), i.e. the representation of a number does not contain two (or more) consecutive ones.

The construction of the computer has proved more demanding than Byteazar supposed. He has difficulties implementing addition. Help him!

TaskWrite a programme which:

reads from the standard input the representations of two positive integers,calculates and writes to the standard output the representation of their sum.
